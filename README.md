# LED Chasing Board
Little PCB that has an LED chaser circuit. The leds should "chase" each other around, and you can change brightness (and I think speed) from the potentiometer. 

I based this off of a flip flop circuit I saw online. I took that design, added a third "flip flop" to it, and added a potentiometer. From there, I designed the PCB and tested it.

For this project, I used 3 capacitors (10uf), 6 resistors (3 220ohm and 3 4.7kohm), 3 leds, 3 NPN transitors, a potentiometer, and a battery holder! Detailed Bill of Materials in the repo.
